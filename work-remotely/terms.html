                    <p>This End User License Agreement ("Agreement") is between you and TrueBloom Ltd ("Company", "we", "us") and governs your use of the Work Remotely application ("App") available on the Apple App Store.</p>

                    <p>By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-dark pt-4">1. License</h2>
                    <p>Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Company grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App on any Apple-branded device that you own or control, as permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-dark pt-4">2. Scope of License</h2>
                    <p>This license does not allow you to use the App on any device that you do not own or control, and you may not distribute or make the App available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, or sublicense the App. You may not copy, decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the App or any updates or any part thereof.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-dark pt-4">3. Subscriptions</h2>
                    <p>The App offers auto-renewable subscription plans that provide access to premium features:</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase. Subscriptions automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. Your account is charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the same price. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings in the App Store after purchase.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-dark pt-4">4. Free Tier</h2>
                    <p>The App provides limited functionality for free, including access to a restricted number of job listings with partial information. Premium subscription unlocks full job details, salary data, advanced filters, and unlimited browsing.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-dark pt-4">5. Content</h2>
                    <p>Job listings displayed in the App are sourced from third-party providers. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or availability of any job listing. We are not responsible for the content of external websites linked from job listings.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-dark pt-4">6. Consent to Use of Data</h2>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-dark pt-4">7. Termination</h2>
                    <p>This Agreement is effective until terminated by you or the Company. Your rights under this Agreement will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the App and destroy all copies.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-dark pt-4">8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
                    <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
