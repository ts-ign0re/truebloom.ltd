                    </ul>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-dark pt-4">3. How We Use Information</h2>
                    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-dark pt-4">4. Third-Party Services &amp; Data Transfers</h2>
                    <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Apple App Store</strong> — for subscription management and payment processing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Apple Push Notification Service</strong> — for delivering push notifications.</li>
                        <li><strong>Anthropic, Inc.</strong> (San Francisco, USA) — for AI-powered resume tailoring. When you use the Resume Service, your resume text is transmitted to Anthropic's API for processing. Anthropic processes this data according to their <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/privacy" class="text-dark underline">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/api-usage-policy" class="text-dark underline">API Usage Policy</a>. Per Anthropic's commercial API terms, data submitted through the API is not used to train their models.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Your resume data may be transferred to and processed in countries outside your country of residence, including the United States and the United Kingdom. By using the Resume Service, you explicitly consent to such international data transfers. Where required by applicable law, we rely on Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or other approved transfer mechanisms.</p>
                    <p>Job listings link to external websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of those websites.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-dark pt-4">5. Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
                    <p>Resume data and tailored versions are stored on our servers for as long as you choose to retain them. You may delete all your resume data at any time through the App's Resume tab (menu → Delete Resume). Upon deletion, all your resume data and tailored versions are permanently and irreversibly removed from our servers. Local data (favorites, preferences) remains on your device and is removed when you delete the App. The anonymous device identifier persists in your device's Keychain and may survive app deletion; you can reset it by resetting your device's Keychain.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-dark pt-4">6. Your Rights</h2>
                    <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                        <li><strong>Right of access</strong> — you can view your resume data directly in the App at any time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to rectification</strong> — you can edit your resume at any time through the App.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to erasure ("right to be forgotten")</strong> — you can permanently delete all your resume data through the App.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to withdraw consent</strong> — you may withdraw consent to AI processing at any time by deleting your resume. Withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing performed prior to withdrawal.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to data portability</strong> — your resume text is accessible in the App and can be copied at any time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to lodge a complaint</strong> — EU/EEA users may file a complaint with their local Data Protection Authority. UK users may contact the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For CCPA/CPRA (California): We do not sell or share your personal information. You have the right to know what data we collect, request deletion, and opt out of any sale (though we do not sell data). For LGPD (Brazil): You have analogous rights under Brazilian law, including the right to access, correct, anonymize, block, or delete your data. Contact us to exercise these rights.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-dark pt-4">7. Data Security</h2>
                    <p>We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including encrypted communications (TLS/HTTPS), access controls, and secure server infrastructure. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-dark pt-4">8. Children's Privacy</h2>
                    <p>The App is not directed at children under 17. We do not knowingly collect information from children. If you believe a child has submitted data through the App, contact us and we will promptly delete it.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-dark pt-4">9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
                    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. If changes are material, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you (e.g., through the App). Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
